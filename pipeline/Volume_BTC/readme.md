the code.

To commit:

  - Click on the blue button with text, `Save Version`
  - Name Version or leave it
  - Select Version type \`Save and Run All (Commit)
  - Click Save

*Note: Run the file as a script*

Now Add the data from your notebook. To Add data:

  - Click on Add data
  - Goto the Kernel Output Files Tab
  - Choose Your Work from the list of tags
  - choose and Add kernel\_for\_inputting\_data
